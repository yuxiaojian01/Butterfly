A game for mobile phones should be â€œMOBILE"!

Feel guilty of playing mobile games on a sofa or even lying on a bed? (add weights to your body, waste your time...)
Want to play a game not only for fun but also for your health?
Do you know that your phone has lots of sensors that can enhance your feeling of the world?

We are not playing a game! We are exploring a new world, a new world with "real" butterfies! 

We believe a game for mobile phones should be "Mobile". That means, a mobile game should exploit the unique features that
only the mobile phones have (compared to a desktop PC). That also means, we should walk, run or even jump to play the game.
With the help of phone sensors and camera, we are able to display a virtual thing just as a real one on your screen! You can
chase it, catch it or even create it!

Open this game, you will also open your camera. But wait! In addition to the real world you see from the camera, you will 
also see a lot of butterflies, just as real ones! You can walk towards them and catch them. Note, they are "real" butterflies
and you can only catch them when you are close enough to them.
